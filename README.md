# React Query Examples
This is a simple experiment of React Query caching behaviour.

## Set up
1. pull this repo.
2. yarn install.

## How to run
1. `node server.js` to run the api server
2. `yarn start` for front end
3. Go to `http:localhost:3000` in your browser (if it does not open automatically).

# What can you see in the app
React query will keep the query cache between the pages, and use it until new data comes back to the page you are revisiting.

## Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
